🖐️ Hand Recognition Project

This project is designed to recognize hand gestures using computer vision techniques. It uses Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning approaches to detect and classify hand movements in real time.

🚀 Features

✋ Detects hand using the camera

🧠 Applies image processing & machine learning models

🎯 Identifies different hand gestures

📷 Real-time video capture and prediction

💻 Simple & easy-to-use interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Machine Learning / Deep Learning

MediaPipe (if used)
